- try mounting gdrive with rclone
- add gdrive workflow support
- Check for outliers in lab results
- Ask GPT to find outliers in lab results
- last should have last values and if it was ever outside range
- remove date source file page number
- make last csv not have the text
- make last csv have source file
- make last csv have enums
- phase 1 extract, standardize units,dont swap if unavailable but add to map and then we use grmini
- retry zeroshot single image extraction
- reduce target list by mapping to LOINQ codes
- use thinking model for extraction in single pass
- Collect raw labs from all pages, then manually use GPT 4.1 to create a mapping dataset, then just manually add missing ones 
- Combine embedding retrieval with LLM for classificaiton (select top K embeddings, then use LLM to classify)
- Convert to command-line tool installable with pipx
- Date injection from first page, won't work when just regenerating specific pages
- Perform assertions during steps
- Added outlier detection (let llm judge based on user data)
- Add support for LOINQ codes
- Prefix lab test names with LOINQ codes
- Convert lab spec names to standard names with LOINQ codes
- Generate excel instead of csv
- Get rid of lab_methods.json method, let LLM map to LOINQ codes instead
- Add converted ranges to latest csv
- Create validation mode that validates all schemas
- Decouple unit standardization, do that in another pass
- Perform post json merge validation
- Match fields against enum and convert units/ranges to create .augmented.json
- Create csv from .augmented.json
- Create augmented schema and validate against it
