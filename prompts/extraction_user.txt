Please extract ALL lab test results from this medical lab report image.

CRITICAL: For EACH lab test you find, you MUST extract:
1. lab_name_raw - The test name EXACTLY as shown (required)
2. value_raw - The result value EXACTLY as shown (ALWAYS PUT THE RESULT HERE - whether numeric or text)
3. lab_unit_raw - The unit EXACTLY as shown (extract what you see, can be null if no unit)
4. reference_range - The reference range text (if visible)
5. reference_min_raw and reference_max_raw - Parse the numeric bounds from the reference range

Extract test names, values, units, and reference ranges EXACTLY as they appear.
Pay special attention to preserving the exact formatting and symbols.

CRITICAL: Extract EVERY lab test you see, including:
- Numeric results → Put in value_raw (examples: "5.2", "14.8", "0.75")
- Text-based qualitative results → Put in value_raw (examples: "NEGATIVO", "POSITIVO", "NORMAL", "AMARELA", "NAO CONTEM", "AUSENTE", "PRESENTE")
- Range results → Put in value_raw (examples: "1 a 2", "1-5 / campo", "0-3 / campo")

IMPORTANT: The value_raw field should contain the ACTUAL TEST RESULT, whether it's a number or text.
Do NOT put test results in the comments field - that's only for additional notes.
Do NOT skip or omit text-based results - they are just as important as numeric results.

Also set page_has_lab_data:
- true if this page contains lab test results
- false if this is a cover page, instructions, or administrative content with no lab tests

BEFORE OUTPUTTING EACH RESULT, VERIFY:
✓ lab_name_raw contains ONLY the test name (no values, units, or ranges)
✓ value_raw contains ONLY the result (no test names or units)
✓ lab_unit_raw contains ONLY the unit (no values)
✓ No field contains text like "value_raw:", "lab_unit_raw:", etc.
